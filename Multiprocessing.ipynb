        "multiprocessing in Python allows running multiple processes concurrently, leveraging multiple CPU cores for better performance. It is useful for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation, as it bypasses Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), unlike threading. Each process runs in its own memory space, enabling true parallel execution. This improves performance, especially for tasks like image processing or complex calculations, by utilizing the full potential of multi-core systems.\n",
