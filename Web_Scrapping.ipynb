        "### 1. **Manual Copy-Pasting**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The simplest form of scraping.\n",
        "* Involves manually copying data from a webpage and pasting it into a file or spreadsheet.\n",
        "* Suitable for small amounts of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **HTML Parsing**\n",

        "* Allows easy navigation and extraction of specific elements using tags, classes, or IDs.\n",

        "* Accesses the Document Object Model (DOM) of the webpage using browsers or tools like **Selenium** or **Puppeteer**.\n",
        "* Useful for scraping data from JavaScript-heavy websites that require interaction (like clicking or scrolling).\n",
