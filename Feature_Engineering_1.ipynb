        "4. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** (if imputation is built in)\n",

              "'\\nQ11: You discover that the dataset is unbalanced with a low percentage of occurrences while working on a project that requires you to estimate the occurrence of a rare event. What methods can you employ to balance the dataset and up-sample the minority class?\\n\\nTo handle class imbalance when the rare event (minority class) is underrepresented, **up-sampling** the minority class can help balance the dataset. Below are effective techniques:\\n\\n1. **Random Over-Sampling:**\\n   - Replicate samples from the minority class until it matches the size of the majority class.\\n\\n   Example:\\n   --------\\n   from sklearn.utils import resample\\n   import pandas as pd\\n\\n   # Create an imbalanced dataset\\n   df = pd.DataFrame({\\n       \\'event\\': [\\'no\\'] * 90 + [\\'yes\\'] * 10,\\n       \\'value\\': list(range(100))\\n   })\\n\\n   # Separate minority and majority classes\\n   df_majority = df[df.event == \\'no\\']\\n   df_minority = df[df.event == \\'yes\\']\\n\\n   # Upsample minority class\\n   df_minority_upsampled = resample(df_minority,\\n                                    replace=True,              # Sample with replacement\\n                                    n_samples=len(df_majority),# Match majority class\\n                                    random_state=42)\\n\\n   # Combine majority and upsampled minority\\n   df_balanced = pd.concat([df_majority, df_minority_upsampled])\\n\\n   print(\"Balanced dataset:\\n\", df_balanced[\\'event\\'].value_counts())\\n\\n2. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):**\\n   - Generates synthetic samples for the minority class using k-nearest neighbors.\\n\\n   Example:\\n   --------\\n   from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\\n   from collections import Counter\\n   from sklearn.datasets import make_classification\\n\\n   # Sample imbalanced data\\n   X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=2, weights=[0.9, 0.1], random_state=42)\\n\\n   print(\"Original class distribution:\", Counter(y))\\n\\n   sm = SMOTE(random_state=42)\\n   X_resampled, y_resampled = sm.fit_resample(X, y)\\n\\n   print(\"Resampled class distribution:\", Counter(y_resampled))\\n\\n3. **Use Class Weighting in Algorithms:**\\n   - Specify `class_weight=\\'balanced\\'` in classifiers like `LogisticRegression`, `RandomForestClassifier`, etc.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nUp-sampling prevents the model from being biased toward the majority class. Choose the method based on your dataset size and whether synthetic generation (like SMOTE) makes sense contextually.\\n'"
