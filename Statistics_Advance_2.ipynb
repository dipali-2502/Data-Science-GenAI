        "\n",
        "1. **Natural Occurrence**: Many real-world phenomena naturally follow a normal distribution due to the **Central Limit Theorem**, which states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, random variables tends to be normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution.\n",

        "2. **Statistical Inference**: A large number of statistical methods (confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression analysis) assume that the data is normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Predictability**: In a normal distribution, we know the proportion of data within certain standard deviations:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * About **68%** of the data lies within 1 standard deviation (σ) of the mean (μ)\n",
        "   * About **95%** within 2σ\n",
        "   * About **99.7%** within 3σ\n",
        "     This is known as the **Empirical Rule**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Basis for Standard Scores (Z-scores)**: The normal distribution allows us to calculate Z-scores, which help in comparing data points from different distributions.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Exam Scores**: In large-scale testing (like SAT, GRE), student scores are often normally distributed due to the diversity of test-takers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Measurement Errors**: In scientific experiments and engineering, errors in repeated measurements tend to be normally distributed due to small random fluctuations.\n",
